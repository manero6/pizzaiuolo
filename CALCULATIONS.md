# Calculations
## Poolish 100% + Biga 50%
The goal here is to have all the water and all the flour mixed together, instead of:

- having a poolish which means adding flour after ca. one day
- having a biga which means adding water after ca. one day

With this method all the ingredients are mixed and the poolish and biga can be added together after ca. one day.

How quantities grows starting from 50% hydration to 100% hydration. Some examples:

- Percentage calculation:
  - Biga Water: `100 - hydration`
  - Biga Flour: `(100 - hydration) * 2`
  - Poolish Water and Flour: `(hydration - 50) * 2`
