## Poolish 100% + Biga 50%
The goal here is to have all the water and all the flour mixed together, instead of:

- having a poolish which means adding flour after ca. one day
- having a biga which means adding water after ca. one day

With this method all the ingredients are mixed and the poolish and biga can be added together after ca. one day.
